Do you want to travel with me? 

I don't relly mind what your answer will be. Whether you go with me or not, I will still continue with my plan and go somewhere I've never been. I have been living to travel. I am working so hard so I have some money to spend for my next destination. Traveling is my sweer escape, and through it, I get to know who the real me. I get the chance to see the real world. I get the opportunity to become better. I make everything for my trips to be possible. And how I can manage that one? Check it out [here](http://vippinurkka.fi/).
